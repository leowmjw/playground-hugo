Masa tunggu untuk perjalanan A & B masing-masing ialah 120 and 116 saat. Manakala masa tunggu C hanya 92 saat sahaja. Ini menyebabkan kesesakan lalulintas di perjalanan A & B. Saya cadangkan untuk mengurangkan masa tunggu untuk perjalan A & B memandangkan ini adalah jalan besar yang menanggung lebih banyak kenderaan. Perjalanan dari Persiaran Puteri (C) yang kurang kenderaan menikmati lampu hijau selama 72 saat, ini tidak betul! Saya telah pun membuat siasatan di tapak dan mendapati kebanyakan masa Persiaran Puteri sudah tiada kenderaan melalui garisan lampu isyarat selepas 30 saat lampu hijau dinyalakan. Saya hendak cadangkan supaya mengurangkan lampu hijau di Persiaran Puteri (perjalanan C) kepada 40 saat sahaja. Cara yang lebih berkesan ialah memasang \"Sensor\" di garisan lampu isyarat Persiaran Puteri untuk mengesan kenderaan. Sekiranya sudah tiada kenderaan melalui \"Sensor\" maka ia sepatutnya menukar kepada lampu merah untuk memberi laluan perjalan A & B."}
