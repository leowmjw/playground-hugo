They set up tables on the streets - both side and front, and their patrons park their vehicles without a care for residents in the area -- the manner they park their vehicles have time and again been obstructive and a hazard, and pose a high risk for accidents to occur. Does the restaurant have a valid licence to operate, and what are the parameters that they can operate in -- spill out onto the streets? Despite they hiring RELA personnel to man the traffic, vehicles are parked any which way the drivers fancy -- obstructing traffic flow to roads within the neighborhood.\n\nThe motor workshops (neighbouring lots of the restaurant) park their used / vehicles under repair along the roads of SS14/6J and SS14/6L. Residents have written many times to the ADUN of Subang Jaya and MPSJ to complain. All MPSJ does is come by and stick stickers to remove on the vehicles. Nothing concrete nor permanent has come through.

They set up tables on the streets - both side and front, and their patrons park their vehicles without a care for residents in the area -- the manner they park their vehicles have time and again been obstructive and a hazard, and pose a high risk for accidents to occur. Does the restaurant have a valid licence to operate, and what are the parameters that they can operate in -- spill out onto the streets? Despite they hiring RELA personnel to man the traffic, vehicles are parked any which way the drivers fancy -- obstructing traffic flow to roads within the neighborhood.\n\nThe motor workshops (neighbouring lots of the restaurant) park their used / vehicles under repair along the roads of SS14/6J and SS14/6L.

Now, they are disposing of all waste at the Section 21, Shah Alam landfill instead of the one at Jeram, Just to ease the contractors \". \"They can't take home the rubbish which they have collected if the landfill is closed when they arrive,\" said the mayor.\n\nHe hope by shifting to a closer landfill, the city's waste management will improve greatly. This is where the problem started.\n\nProperties are usually set aside for the safe treatment and/or disposal of such materials, away from access by the general public. If such a site is properly maintained, there is little hazard from living within the regulated limit of proximity to such a piece of property. However, if a landfill or hazardous waste site has been neglected or improperly maintained, serious health hazards could be a risk.\n\nThe federal and state governments closely regulate the transportation and disposal of such substances with the safety of the public in mind.\n\nHealth Effects\n\nLiving in proximity to a poorly maintained landfill or hazardous waste site can cause serious health effects, especially in children. Health effects from exposure to hazardous waste can include: •Cancer •Birth defects •Genetic mutations\n\nExposure to harmful chemicals can come from:\n\nAir - Toxic chemicals from the soil can be vaporized in areas such as basements, causing high concentrations of hazardous chemical gases in the home.\n\nGroundwater - If harmful chemicals are present in the soil surrounding a water supply, they can seep into the water supply and cause harmful effects, even in small amounts.\n\nSoil - If a former landfill or waste site is developed as commercial or residential property without going through the proper abatement/remediation measures, soil can remain contaminated long after waste dumping has ceased. Harmful chemicals may be absorbed through the skin after contact with contaminated soil, and vegetables and other edible plants grown in such soil can absorb chemicals.\n\nSome researchers have determined that the overall risk of birth defects may be increased slightly by living close to a hazardous waste site, but if the site is well maintained and proper habitation distances are observed, the risk is minimal.\n\nEnvironmental Effects and Proximity Regulations\n\nSince the environmental and health effects of landfills and hazardous waste sites can be extensive, the regulation of such sites is of great concern to the EPA and other government agencies. There are many restrictions and regulations regarding such sites, and all are designed with public safety in mind. Some of the regulations include: •Monitoring of groundwater and soil to ensure that chemical levels are within acceptable ranges •Use of liners (usually plastic sheets and layered clay) to prevent leakage of hazardous materials •Location restrictions to ensure that no potential leakage hazard could come from nearby geological attributes such as faults and wetlands •Safe operating practices regarding the control of waste exposure, etc. •Closure regulations concerning the safe maintenance and monitoring of closed landfills and hazardous waste sites •Corrective action for any potential leakages from waste sites\n\nAlthough present safety measures address the usage of former landfill sites as commercial or residential property, due to possible past errors in property record keeping, it is still possible for developers to unknowingly purchase and develop or resell land that was used for waste disposal purposes. Before buying property or a home, even one that is brand new, you should research the land to ascertain whether it was previously used as a landfill or toxic waste dump.\n\nProperty Values\n\nProximity to landfills and hazardous waste sites can severely affect property values. Any property close to an active landfill will probably be devalued as a matter of course. Depending on how close the property lies to the site, whether the site is still active, and (if not active) if the waste has been properly encapsulated or removed, the value of a tract of land or home could be affected in many different ways. For example, if an active landfill is declared \"closed\" and proper measures are taken to ensure that there is no risk of contamination from the waste therein, the value of a nearby property may rise from the low value it had from being located near an active waste site. Devalued property may further regain some of its previous value if the former waste site is improved or developed commercially. However, if the waste site is not properly closed and encapsulated, or if waste leaks into the surrounding properties while or after it is active, property values may be irreversibly lowered.\n\nExposure Reduction\n\nThere is very little a homeowner can do to reduce exposure to chemicals from a nearby waste site; it is the job of the waste site’s overseers to make sure that harmful chemicals do not escape the waste site. It is likely that if there is a serious health risk from a nearby waste site, then the surrounding property may become unlivable (i.e., well-water may become undrinkable, or the soil may be irreversibly contaminated). The best course of action to take when purchasing or living on property near to an active or former waste site is to be informed and follow the precautionary measures (such as regular soil and water testing) recommended by your local health department or the EPA."],"interface_used":["Web interface"],"description":["Landfill nearby usj .hazardous!!!: Petaling Jaya mayor Datuk Mohamad Roslan Sakiman said the current arrangement to dispose of city waste at Jeram, Kuala Selangor, was time consuming and inconvenient for the contractors.
